          Operation starfall is a <a href="UnityProjectsEN.html">Unity</a> project that people have been working on for years, and when
          I was asked to add something to the game, I thought making a new weapon could be fun, since the only thing you could use to 
          defeat enemies was a sword. I decided to make a scythe, but to start that I needed to make the weapon system modular first.
          <br>
          I also made the scythe model in the game in blender myself.<img src="Images/Scythe.jpg" width="500" height="300">
