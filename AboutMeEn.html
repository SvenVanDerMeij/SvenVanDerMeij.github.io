        Hello, I'm Sven van der Meij, I'm from Assendelft, The Netherlands. I'm 19 years old, and am studying software development at Mediacollege Amsterdam and am a delivery driver for IKEA part time 
        I like to play video games, go to the movies with friends, or cook or bake something I haven't made before in my free time. I chose to
        do software development because I've played video games my whole life, and it's something I'm very passionate about. After I had to do a small programming assignment in highschool, I decided that this was what I wanted to do with my life.
        When I create, I see it as an opportunity to express my creativity, and subvert common videogame tropes and genres to create something entirely new.

    <p> A big inspiration for me is the 2007 Pixar film ratatoullie, especially the scene near the beginning of the movie where remy takes the piece of cheese and the strawberry to taste them together, and discovers a whole new flavor and experience, simply bycombining two already existing things.
        Moments like that while programming are what i find most joy in while working.</p>
         <p>
            I want to be the type of developer that comes up with creative solutions to problems, and finds new and interresting 
            subversions on already existing genres and mechanics to further expand the ideas. Video games are undoubtly a form of art,
            and I hope you can look through my projects, and see my vision.
         </p>
