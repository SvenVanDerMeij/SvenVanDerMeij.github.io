          I have limited experience in JavaScript, but the things I have made, I'm very proud of. Firstly I made a space invaders clone in P5.JS
          as my very first project back when I studied at the AUAS. I wouldn't really describe P5.JS as a game making tool, It's more for simulations
          and precisely moving around primitive shapes, after 10 weeks I managed to create <a href ="https://propedeuse-gd.dev.hihva.nl/2022-2023/blok-1/Sven_van_der_Meij_SpaceInvaders/game/">this.</a>

            Het is best basic voor zover space invaders clones gaan, maar het was uitstekende oefening met Javascript waardoor ik uiteindelijk 
            dit kon maken:
            It's pretty basic as far as space invaders clones go, but it was excellent practice with Javascript, which allowed me to make this.

            The reviews never overlap, I made this for the NXT museum in year one at MediaCollege Amsterdam. It was a 2 person assignment where we had to make
            a website for the modern art museum NXT in Amsterdam. The part with the reviews was made exclusively by me, the full website is
