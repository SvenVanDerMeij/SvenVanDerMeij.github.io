            For This <a href="UnityProjectsEN.html">unity </a> game, I made for a school project, I decided to make a variation on the typical tower
            defense formula. Tower defense is one of <a href="favouriteGamesEN.html">my favourite video game genres</a> and I had a good idea
            for how to differentiate this tower defense game from the others. I made all the <a href="SpriteWorkEN.html"> sprite artwork myself in asesprite,</a>
             but the thing I'm most proud of in this game is the enemy movement. Put simply, every enemy knows of every tile where they can change
             direction, when it touches one of these points it checks every other tile ajacent to it, picks a random one, and makes that the new 
             target destination. When the enemy touches a winning point, you get cash, and when it touches a losing point, you lose lives. The goal
             of the game is to direct them away from one exit, and lead them to the other exit. I made this visual sheet to hopefully explain it
             clearer if it isn't already.
