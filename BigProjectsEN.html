    The big projects i want to talk about are cuphead vertical slice, and frog tower defense.

            Cuphead vertical slice
            </a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cuphead vertical slice was an assignment where you as a group had to recreate a 10 second clip from the 2017 indie game cuphead
         to the best of your abilities.I want to showcase 3 of my contributions to the project, the boss, the movement of the platforms, and the animation system.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The boss
    </h4>
    <div class="floatRight">

    </div>
    <p>
        I've made the ai for the boss explained in the image on the right, I'll talk about the ai for the platforms later, 
        but first I'll show the code for the boss itself.
    </p>

<p>
        Here you can see that I did the Boss' vertical movement with a simple sine wave, making him gently bob up and down, je "Bonus"
        varable makes it so that when the boss loses all it's health, the bonus drops below zero, making the boss plummet, and making the player win.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The platforms
    </h4>
    <div class="floatRight">
        <img src="Images/CupheadPlatformCode.png" >
    </div>
    <p>
        The platforms are very simple, they start by checking their own y-position, and saving that, after that they're constantly moving
        up and down with a less intense sine wave. When hit with a fireball, they fall off screen, at which point a timer starts counting up
        when this timer hits 4 seconds, the platform comes back up, until they've reached the y-position saved at the start. When they're back 
        at their original positions, they become hittable again by the boss' fireball, and the player can jump on them again.        
    </p>
    <h4>
        The animation
    </h4>
    <p>
        The player's animation gave us a bit of trouble until I came up with a solution. The problem came from the fact that cuphead has 
        an animation for walking, jumping, shooting, and walking and shooting, and those animations overlapped a lot of the time. It wasn't uncommon for the game
        to play the walking animation, then jump, but because you were still moving mid air, the walking animation would play. My solution
        was to implement a binary system, where jumping, shooting and walking were each a bit in a 3-bit sequence, the first bit(4) being jumping, the second(2) beingshooting
        and the third bit (1) being walking. When you start walking, the walking bit adds 1 to the animation integer, along with the other
        two bits and their respective value, for example if the player is walking and jumping at the same time, the integer will be 4+1=5
        and thus the corresponding animation plays, being the "walking while jumping" animation. If this is still unclear, I hope the 
        image I made below will clear things up.

            </a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Frog tower defense was an assignment where we had to make a tower defense game, simple as that. I decided to make a variation
        of what you would expect from a typical tower defense. Instead of trying to defeat the enemies before they reach the end, I 
        made the map have two exits, a good one and a bad one, where the objective for the player is to redirect the enemies towards the 
        good exit, losing lives when they go into the bad exit. The only other thing I want to show off is how the enemies move, which you can see in the image below. Every other
        aspect is a typical tower defense.
