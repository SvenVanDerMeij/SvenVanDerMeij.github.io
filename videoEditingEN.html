            Although my experience with video editing is limited, I think it's a very fun expression of my creativity and sense of humor.
            A good example of this is  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSUbL7qjwkE">"BWP proffesionaliteit"</a> and though the video in it's entirety
            wasn't solely my creation, the other people in the video also helped with brainstorming, the editing was done by me and me alone
             in Davinci Resolve.

            now I get it if you saw that video and didn't think it's very serious, and I completely agree, for something more formal and serious
            I have <a href="https://youtu.be/KCR72kFFcC4">the testfootage I made for cuphead.</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVY-NCCjpcY">the showreel for Operation starfall</a>
